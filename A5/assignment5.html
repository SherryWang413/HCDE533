            <h1>Assignment 5: Getting Meshy and Lamps</h1>

            This assignment includes two parts, the first being that we should find two STL files online, repair them and join them to produce a single printable STL. Since Thanksgiving is approaching (and I haven't decided what my lamp would look like yet), I decided to put together something that's autumn-y.
            </p>
            <p>
            I went on Thingiverse and found two STL files, a munchkin and a silly turkey. I'm including these files under Source files at the bottom of this page. For reference, here are the original links:<br/>
            <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1836056/files"> Munchkin and other pumpkins </a> <br/>
            <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1124349/files"> Silly little turkey </a>
            </p>
            <p>
            I downloaded these files and imported the munchkin first into Rhino.
            </p>
            <p>
            <img src="open_munch.png" width=600></a>
            </p>
            <p>
            As you see, this was an open mesh. So following the footsteps of Nadya, I decided to reduce the mesh a little bit to see if it could be closed. The original polygon count was 173,419, and I first entered 170,000, not wanting the munchkin to be distorted.
            </p>
            <p>
            <img src="reduce_mesh.png" width=600></a>
            </p>
            <p>
            I got lucky, since after that reduction, the mesh was closed!
            </p>
            <p>
            Next, I imported the turkey in. Again I was lucky - the original file was already a closed mesh!
            </p>
    
            <p>
            As I had both meshes closed, all that was left was to join them together. But before that, my turkey was too small compared to the munchkin, so I decided to scale it up.
            </p>
            <p>
            <img src="small_turkey.png" width=600></a>
            </p>
            <p>
            I made it 3 times larger using the "Scale" command and moved the turkey to be standing on top of the munchkin, and voila! I was done. I joined them, confirmed that the final piece was still a closed mesh, and exported it into a new STL file.
            </p>
            <p>
            <img src="final.png" width=600></a>
            </p>
            <p>
            My meshing process went very smoothly, and I think it was mainly because I was using relatively easy files (unlike baby Yoda, of course) and the creators of the files were very nice people!
            </p>


            <p>
            Now for the lamp,
