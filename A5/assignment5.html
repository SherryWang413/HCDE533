            <h1>Assignment 5: Getting Meshy and Lamps</h1>

            This assignment includes two parts, the first being that we should find two STL files online, repair them and join them to produce a single printable STL. Since Thanksgiving is approaching (and I haven't decided what my lamp would look like yet), I decided to put together something that's autumn-y.
            </p>
            <p>
            I went on Thingiverse and found two STL files, a munchkin and a silly turkey. I'm including these files under Source files at the bottom of this page. For reference, here are the original links:<br/>
            <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1836056/files"> Munchkin and other pumpkins </a> <br/>
            <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1124349/files"> Silly little turkey </a>
            </p>
            <p>
            I downloaded these files and imported the munchkin first into Rhino.
            </p>
            <p>
            <img src="open_munch.png" width=600></a>
            </p>
            <p>
            As you see, this was an open mesh. So following the footsteps of Nadya, I decided to reduce the mesh a little bit to see if it could be closed. The original polygon count was 173,419, and I first entered 170,000, not wanting the munchkin to be distorted.
            </p>
            <p>
            <img src="reduce_mesh.png" width=600></a>
            </p>
            <p>
            I got lucky, since after that reduction, the mesh was closed!
            </p>
            <p>
            Next, I imported the turkey in. Again I was lucky - the original file was already a closed mesh!
            </p>
    
            <p>
            As I had both meshes closed, all that was left was to join them together. But before that, my turkey was too small compared to the munchkin, so I decided to scale it up.
            </p>
            <p>
            <img src="small_turkey.png" width=600></a>
            </p>
            <p>
            I made it 3 times larger using the "Scale" command and moved the turkey to be standing on top of the munchkin, and voila! I was done. I joined them, confirmed that the final piece was still a closed mesh, and exported it into a new STL file.
            </p>
            <p>
            <img src="final.png" width=600></a>
            </p>
            <p>
            My meshing process went very smoothly, and I think it was mainly because I was using relatively easy files (unlike baby Yoda, of course) and the creators of the files were very nice people!
            </p>

            <p>
            Now for the lamp, I started jumping through rabbit holes online. From <a href="https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.architecturaldigest.com/gallery/best-table-lamps-and-bedside-lamps/amp"> Best Table Lamps </a>, I discovered a type called "origami lamps", which people use rice paper to create. As I dug deeper into handmade lamps, I went on Etsy and saw more wooden lights like <a href="https://www.etsy.com/listing/1256269786/wooden-pendant-lampshade-freya-wood-lamp?ref=listing_page_ad_row-3&pro=1&frs=1&sts=1&plkey=a66c6e111207782f7398dea3063099a564340772%3A1256269786"> this</a> and <a href="https://www.etsy.com/listing/991394543/natural-walnut-lamp-the-majesty-hand?ref=listing_page_ad_row-2&pro=1&frs=1&sts=1&plkey=29ac5843b9bf3ce104f8411b363354d4a910c4b2%3A991394543"> that</a>. I was fascinated by the wavy structure, and recalled that lattice hinge could help achieve that when laser cutting.
            </p>

            <p>
            Then I started learning all about lattice hinge. At first, I got an existing open source file of the <a href="LatticeHingeBending_EchantillonsSimples.gh"> pattern</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
            <img src="lattice_hinge.png" width=600></a>
            </p>
            <p>
            It was in French, so I had to learn a new language to read the Grasshopper definition. I did that and successfully baked the pattern, but realized the pattern had constraints that could only work for rectangles. For my situation, as I was aiming for a table lamp that can stand stably, I wanted a traingular shape. As a result, although this was a comprehensive and complicated definition, I couldn't use it.
            </p>
            <p>
            Lucky for me, the website where I got the lattice hinge pattern from was also selling wooden lamps. Here's an image of a triangular lamp that they were selling. I did not purchase the product, so the image was as vague as possible.
            </p>
            <p>
            <img src="reference.jpeg" width=600></a>
            </p>
            <p>
            I decided to follow this image and tried designing the side shades first. I had several attempts when creating the lattice hinges by myself, due to the traingle side having curvy edges and me hoping the hinges to match those curves. I wanted to use Grasshopper to create a definition, but when creating the curvy edges, I did it manually for a natural feeling, so functions were not of use. In the end, I wrote down all the dimensions of the hinges in a notebook and here's the result:
            </p>
            <p>
            <img src="side.png" width=600></a><br/>
            For the dimension of the lamp, the reference website had it at 30x30x30 cm, so I did the same.
            </p>
            <p>
            The next piece I created was the top of the lamp, which was a triangle. Since it would be attached to the top of the side shades, the dimensions should match. So I went for an equilateral triangle with 10cm edges. I filleted the corners to be round, also for a natural vibe. For pieces to be held together, gaps were created. I referred to the website once again and put the gaps at the corners, each taking 4.8mm width and 20mm length. The width was the same as the thickness of woodboards I would be using. I filleted the sharp corners using a radius of 1, so that when assembling, it would be easier.
            </p>
            <p>
            <img src="top.png" width=600></a>
            </p>
            <p>
            And that's all I did for the first part of the lamp! I found and modified a design I like, finished the most difficult part, a.k.a. the lattice hinges, and started working on other parts!
