            <h1>Assignment 3: Getting started with 3D printing</h1>
            
            <p>
            By Sherry Wang
            </p>
            <p>
            Here is the finished and assembled piece for assignment 1, including 12 large circles and 30 small ones:
            </p>
            <p>
            <img src="placed.jpg" width=600></a>
            </p>
            <p>
            I came across this picture while searching on the Internet for some inspirations:
            </p>
            <p>
            <img src="source.JPG" width=400></a>
            </p>
            <p>
            The source file can be found via the watermark or from this link: <a href="http://xhslink.com/5iHYqk"> http://xhslink.com/5iHYqk </a> <br/>              
            Using this picture and my vague memory about polygons, I determined the degrees of gaps of each circle (12 large ones and 30 small ones):
            </p>
            <p>
            <img src="angles.png" width=400></a>
            </p>
            <p>
            Then I found some cardboards and measured the thickness of them. I realized that different places have slightly different thickness, ranging from 3.3mm to 3.9mm.
            </p>
            <p>
            <img src="33.jpg" width=300>
            <img src="39.jpg" width=300></a>
            </p>
            <p>
            I also recalled Junchao's reminder that the laser might burn away some material, so I decided to use 3.0mm as the width of my gaps.
            </p>
            <p>
            Once all data are figured out, I began drawing the shapes in Rhino.<br/>
            The two shapes are similar, combining a circle and some rectangles together and then trimming down.<br/>
            I used something I learned from Junchao's demo video, which was command "ArrayPolar". This allowed me to quickly drew symmetrical rectangles spreading equally across the circle.<br/>
            I also extruded the shapes to get a clearer feeling of the finished pieces.
            </p>
            <p>
            <img src="extruded.png" width=600></a>
            </p>
            <p>
            Before cutting, I exported the curves from Rhino to Adobe Illustrator and duplicated them with the desired amount and size. I also adjusted the stroke thickness, which is why this picture looks a little fuzzy.
            </p>
            <p>
            <img src="Capture.JPG" width=600></a>
            </p>
            <p>
            On the laser cutter, I used settings: speed 25, power 40, freq 10.<br/>
            I test cutted a LOT of pieces (there was a malfuction of the machine) and then finished the rest.
            </p>
            <p>
            <img src="cutting.jpg" width=400></a>
            </p>
            <p>
            And finally for the last step, I assembled everything together and it looked great! I can even lift it up!
