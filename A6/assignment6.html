            <h1>Assignment 6: Molding and Casting</h1>

            For the first week of this assignment, I focused on the ideation and design. I was inspired to make a cactus, and as I was looking through thingiverse, I noticed this <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2956910"> cactus ring stand</a>. So I downloaded the stl file to take a look.
            </p>
            <p>

            </p>
            <p>
            This mesh was closed and looked very promising. Since we were asked to do a 2-part mold, I started cutting it in half using the "MeshBooleanSplit" command and got two open meshes as a result.
            </p>
            <p>
            <img src="fail_split.png" width=600></a>
            </p>
            <p>
            That wasn't good, so I used "Check Mesh" and "Repair Mesh", hoping to bring it back to the right track. Even without using commands, I noticed the holes that appeared in my split master piece:
            </p>
            <p>
            <img src="hole.png" width=600></a>
            </p>
            <p>
            I tried so hard but still failed to make these halves back to closed meshes. I also tried to use other cactus thing files but encountered similar issues. As I began to feel desparate, I suddenly recalled that when I imported the original cactus stl file in, it contained two closed meshes - the cactus and the holder dish.
            </p>
            <p>
            <img src="closed.png" width=600></a>
            </p>
            <p>
            That's when I began to consider the possibility of having these two existing closed meshes as two parts of my mold. Instead of the two parts being symmetrical and split from the middle, I would compromise to do two completely different molds. Another change I made was switching the curved holder dish to a simple cylinder so that no overlap would occur among the two parts of the mold.
            </p>
            <p>
            So, using the cactus' bottom as the base, I created a box around it and made sure the box was larger than the holder dish, so that two parts would be able to piece together. I also added four concave spheres as keys/registration points, each having a radius of 5.25mm for some tolerance for ease of joining.
            </p>
            <p>
            For the holder dish's box, I used the same bottom but a different height. I also added the pour + vent hole. I didn't make the hole too small, since it would be not only difficult to pour plaster in but also unnecessary for the flat cylinder. For this box's keys, I added four convex spheres with radii of 5mm. And here's a perspective view of the outcome:
            </p>

            </p>
            <p>
            After making sure this mold for mold was correct, I started the 3d printing process. At first, I exported my two parts together in one single stl file. But as I printed, the filament kept messing up no matter how I adjusted the bed level. I realized it might be because the two parts were aligned horizontally, ending up with a great width, but the printer was most efficient printing in the middle. Therefore, I broke down the two parts into two stl files so that the printer would print separately.
            </p>
            <p>
            As of now (Tuesday 2PM), I'm still in the progress of printing:
