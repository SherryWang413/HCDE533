            <h1>Assignment 1: Modelling and Laser Cutting</h1>
            
            <p>
            By Sherry Wang<br/>
            Here is the finished and assembled piece for assignment 1:

            <p>
            I came across this picture while searching on the Internet for some inspirations:
            </p>
            <p>
            <img src="source.JPG" width=400></a>
            </p>
            <p>
            The source file can be found via the watermark or from this link: http://xhslink.com/5iHYqk <br/>
            Using this picture and my Math major in college, I determined the degrees of each circle (two in total)
            </p>

            </p>
            <p>
            Then I found some cardboards and measured the thickness of them. I realized that different places have slightly different thickness, ranging from 3.3mm to 3.9mm.<br/>
            I also recalled Junchao's reminder that the laser might burn away some material, so I decided to use 3.0mm as the width of my gaps.

            </p>
            <p>
            Once all data are figured out, I began drawing the shapes in Rhino.<br/>
            The two shapes are similar, combining a circle and some rectangles together and then trimming down.<br/>
            I used something I learned from Junchao's demo video, which was command "ArrayPolar". This allowed me to quickly drew symmetrical rectangles spreading equally across the circle.<br/>
            I also extruded the shapes to get a clearer feeling of the finished pieces.

            <p>
            On the laser cutter, I used settings: <br/>
            I test cutted a few pieces and then finished the rest.

            </p>
            <p>
            And finally for the last step, I assembled everything together and it looked great!
