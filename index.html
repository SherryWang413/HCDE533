            My name is Sherry Wang. I'm in my second year of HCDE's master program. I majored in Human Factors Engineering during college, but realized that I forgot almost all the CAD stuff I learned at school :/ Therefore, I look forward to learning everything again!

		Assignment 1 was making a press fit construction kit, consisting of at least 30 instances of at least one unique part. I used Rhino, Adobe Illustrator, and a laser cutter.
