            <h1>Final Project Proposal: Foldable Tool Box</h1>
            
            <p>
            By Sherry Wang
            </p>
            <p>
            For this proposal, I'm including the concept, a breakdown of tasks, the timeline, and the bill of materials.
            </p>
            
            <h2>Concept:</h2>
            <p>
            For the final project, I will be designing and building a foldable tool box. I will use a combination of Rhino modeling, Grasshopper parametric design, laser cutting, 3d printing, interference fits, and mechanism. Here's a sketch of the box:
            </p>
            <p>
            <img src="sketch.jpg" width=600></a>
            </p>
            <p>
            I got inspired by this link from Thingiverse: <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:425353"> Foldable Tool Box</a>. This is still a Work in Progress, plus some comments down below say that the dimensions are off, therefore my plan is to use this only as a sketch and design everything from scratch on my own.
            </p>
            <p>
            <img src="reference.png" width=600></a>
            </p>
            <p>
            As the name suggests, the intended use case of this design is to hold tools and/or small items that are easy to lose. It can carry nails, screws, buttons, end mills, etc. When closed, it would be a rectangular box that has three levels of containers - a large one at the bottom, and four smaller drawers on top. When being unfolded, all drawers would expand to show everything inside, in the ease of taking things out.
            </p>

            <h2>Breakdown of Tasks:</h2>
            <p>
            The box can be broken down into two main parts: the containers and the connecting pieces.
            </p>
            <p>
            For the containers, including the caps, I plan to have them laser cutted out of woodboards and press fit together. Since we had an assignment about making boxes (although that was CNC milling), I would be using the similar design plus a YouTube tutorial found on Discord, thanks to Bailey.
            </p>
            <p>
            <img src="boxes.jpg" width=600></a>
            </p>
            <p>
            For the connecting pieces, here's a rough rough sketch. The real pieces would additionally include a design similar to snap buttons at each end, so that they can be press fit into the holes on the containers. These connecting pieces would be 3d printed.
            </p>
            <p>
            <img src="connections.jpg" width=400><img src="details.jpg" width=400></a>
            </p>
            <p>
            Combining these two parts together, tasks that I need to finish are:
            </p>
            <p>
            1. Design the containers and caps in CAD<br/>
            2. Design the connecting pieces in CAD<br/>
            3. Render the design in CAD<br/>
            4. Laser cut the containers and caps at the Mill<br/>
            5. Assemble the containers and caps<br/>
            6. 3d print the connecting pieces<br/>
            7. Assemble the box<br/>
            8. Document everything down, practice the presentation, and submit on Canvas
            </p>

            <h2>Timeline:</h2>
            <p>
            Based on these tasks above, here's a timeline that I will follow strictly:<br/>
            Before everything, I will head to the Mill on Wednesday, before they close, to purchase the plywood so that I will have all the measurements ready.<br/>
            For week 1, which is Thanksgiving (11/23 - 11/29), I will be focusing on <b>CAD modeling</b> and <b>3d printing</b> (task 1 & 2 & 6). Both the containers and connecting pieces will require the use of Grasshopper, which might be time-consuming. Once the design is done (before 11/26), I will start 3d printing first, since the Mill will be closed. Printing should not take too long (before 11/28), as it's the connecting pieces only.<br/>
            For week 2, which is 11/30 - 12/6, the first thing I will do is to head to the Mill to <b>laser cut</b> the containers and caps (task 4 & 5). The contingency plan for the Mill is to contact friends and/or classmates who're working at Microsoft and beg them dearly. Then I will assemble the entire tool box together (task 7). I might need to redesign the models if sizes are off. Once I'm sure all the dimensions and designs are correct, I will render the thing in Rhino and finish the documentation (task 3 & 8).<br/>
            </p>

            <h2>Bill of Materials:</h2>
            <p>
            Besides the usual software, tools, and materials we have been using throughout this quarter, two additional ones are needed for this project:
            </p>
            <p>
            1. Plywood with the thickness of 3/16" (4.76mm), which can be purchased at the Mill using a credit card.<br/>
            2. Glue (normal or wood) to further secure the assembly of the containers, which I already have.
            </p>
